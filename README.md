## *Before* the workshop

If you would like to follow along interactively during the workshop, please do the following before the course starts:

- Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). Use the latest version of Python 3 and be sure to check the box that says "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" if on Windows.

- Please go through the notebook [CrashCourseInPython.ipynb](intro/CrashCourseInPython.ipynb) in the 'intro' folder. It will help you revise the basic functionalities and concepts within Python.
- The CrashCourseInPython.ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook: an open-source web application that allows one to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It comes pre-installed with package distributions like Anaconda. However, if you don't have access to Jupyter/Python on your computer (or run into issues installing Anaconda/Python), you can find an online version of the notebook [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CUAstro-REU-Python-Workshop/2020-workshop/blob/master/intro/CrashCourseInPython.ipynb)!
